# Introducing this application
The meditro application is an application for a hospital with many departments, including the surgery department, dental clinic, and internal medicine
The application displays all doctors in this hospital and presents their experience and explains the speed of response and efficiency of this hospital in treating patients
Note: Most of the texts in this application are randomly generated and can be replaced with real texts to use this application in practical projects.

## Features of this application.
- This site is fast and compatible with search engines
- Responsive: It can be run easily and smoothly on all devices and screens
- It can be modified easily: because status was used in it and all links were placed in it, meaning that if you want a page link, you will change the link from one place only and you do not have to change it in the header or footer
- Each page contains its own component, for example, the card of each doctor. You can easily modify it using it in any part or on any other page because status and props were used to transfer the doctorâ€™s name and description to the new component, meaning that you do not need to modify a lot in code
### notes:

This project was created as a React.js application and it requires many modifications to be ready for practical or actual use. The main purpose of all the projects on my GitHub is to understand how these websites are built rather than deploying ready-made applications for others to use. Yes, you can make modifications and use it for your project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
